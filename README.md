## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes socioeconomic factors influencing hardship levels across Chicago's different neighborhoods. The goal is to identify which parameters had the most influence on the **Hardship Index** and to classify neighborhoods into **high** and **low hardship** categories using **Random Forest Classification**.

## **Dataset & Preprocessing**
- **Dataset:** Chicago Hardship Index data
  - This data set was provided during a census done in 2012
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Removed duplicates and missing values
  - Encoded categorical variables
  - Scaled numeric features where necessary
  - Transformed **Hardship Index** into a binary classification target

## **Modeling Approach**
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV to optimize parameters
- **Final Model Accuracy:** **89.50% (cross-validated)**

## **Key Findings (Feature Importance)**
| Feature                   | Importance |
|---------------------------|------------|
| **Per Capita Income**      | 39.0%      |
| **Households Below Poverty** | 21.0%  |
| **% Without HS Diploma**   | 15.0%      |
| **% Unemployed**           | 13.0%      |
| **Housing Density**        | 7.0%       |
| **% Under 18 or Over 64**  | 5.0%       |

## **Conclusion & Next Steps**
This model provides insights into the factors contributing to the hardship rankings, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in **income support, education, and employment programs**. Notably, **Per Capita Income emerged as the most influential feature**, reinforcing the strong correlation between economic status and hardship levels. Future enhancements could include geospatial analysis and time-series modeling to track trends over time.
